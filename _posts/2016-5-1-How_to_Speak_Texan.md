> The most vicious insult in the Texas lexicon (or the Texicon if you will) is to call someone a damn fool. If you use this epithet, you’re not joking. You think the person in question is an idiot. Not just any idiot, but the kind of idiot who should probably be kept in a quiet room with soft walls and nothing but crayons so they can’t hurt themselves or others with their damn fool ways. This phrase is usually accompanied by quite a bit of head shaking in disbelief that anyone could possibly be so stupid.
