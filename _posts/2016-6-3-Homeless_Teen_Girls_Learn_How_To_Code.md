> The Brookview House is a non-profit that provides shelter to homeless women and children. Among other programs, the non-profit also provides a coding club for teen girls.
>
> The club members are middle or high school girls. Some are already homeless and live in Brookview House and others are at-risk for homelessness and are referred to the program by their schools. Since the girls don’t have computers, they use the ones found at the Brookview’s computer lab.
