text: '> With an advance that one cryptography expert called a "masterpiece," University
  of Texas at Austin computer scientists have developed a new method for producing
  truly random numbers, a breakthrough that could be used to encrypt data, make electronic
  voting more secure, conduct statistically significant polls and more accurately
  simulate complex systems such as Earth''s climate.

  >

  > The new method creates truly random numbers with less computational effort than
  other methods, which could facilitate significantly higher levels of security for
  everything from consumer credit card transactions to military communications.

  >

  > The new method takes two weakly random sequences of numbers and turns them into
  one sequence of truly random numbers. Weakly random sequences, such as air temperatures
  and stock market prices sampled over time, harbor predictable patterns. Truly random
  sequences have nothing predictable about them, like a coin toss.'
