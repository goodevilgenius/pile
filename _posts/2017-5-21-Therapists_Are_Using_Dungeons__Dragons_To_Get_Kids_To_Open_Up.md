type: link

> Adam Davis, co-founder of the _Dungeons & Dragons_ therapy group Wheelhouse Workshop, thinks kids with social issues aren’t being asked the right questions. In a dreary school counselor’s office, it can be hard to engage with "Why aren’t you doing your homework?" and "Have you tried joining clubs?"
