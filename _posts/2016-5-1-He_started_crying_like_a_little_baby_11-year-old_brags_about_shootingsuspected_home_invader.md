> Chris fired a warning shot. The man, who was carrying a stolen
laundry hamper, began running. Chris emptied the magazine, firing off 12
shots by the time the intruder neared a fence in the familyâ€™s front yard,
the 11-year-old told the station.

> The final shot hit the man in the leg as he was hopping the fence, the
boy said.
>
> "I shot through the hamper he was carrying," Chris said. "It was a full
metal jacket bullet. It went straight through the back of his leg. He
started crying like a little baby."
