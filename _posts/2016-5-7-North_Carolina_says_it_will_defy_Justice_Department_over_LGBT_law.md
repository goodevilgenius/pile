title: North Carolina says it will defy Justice Department over LGBT law
type: link

---
> The Justice Department notified Gov. Pat McCrory in a letter Wednesday that the state’s House Bill 2, which restricts transgender bathroom access and has become a focus in the LGBT rights fight, violates sections of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It gave the state until Monday to "remedy" the violations.
>
> On Thursday, North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore said legislators would not meet the federal government’s deadline.
>
> "We will take no action by Monday." "That deadline will come and go. Obviously, we don’t ever want to lose any money, but we’re not going to get bullied by the Obama administration to take action prior to Monday’s date. That’s not how this works."
