type: link

---
> A woman says she's offended after receiving an award from her employer for having the "Best Butt" on staff.
>
> She says on Monday night, during an event where staff was given awards, she received the accolade in full view of about fifty coworkers. The woman says that when the award was given to her by management, she was then told to turn around in front of everyone so people could take pictures of her behind.
>
> The woman says she went to corporate HR and was told by upper-level management the award was not their idea. She says that so far, no one has offered her an apology.

This is a big yikes!
