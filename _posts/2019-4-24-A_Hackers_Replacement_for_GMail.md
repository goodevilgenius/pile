title: A Hacker's Replacement for GMail
type: link

---
I've been toying with the idea of getting rid of GMail, and using notmuch for handling my non-work email.

I was concerned about accessing it from my phone, but this seems like it might suggest a pretty good solution.

I may try this out, and I'll post an update if it works well.
