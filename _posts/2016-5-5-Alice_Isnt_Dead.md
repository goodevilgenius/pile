text: I recently started listening to this new podcast by the folks who brought us
  *Welcome to Night Vale*. In *Alice Isn't Dead*, we follow the story of a woman on
  the road, talking to another woman who isn't there. In each episode, we learn a
  bit more of her story, as she tries to escape the horrors slowly encroaching on
  her.
