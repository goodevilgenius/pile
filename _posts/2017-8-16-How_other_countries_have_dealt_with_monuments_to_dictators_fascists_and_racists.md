I feel pretty strongly that we, in America, should treat monuments to the Confederacy the same way Germany treats monuments to the Third Reich.

The Civil War was a terrible mistake, and a blight on our nation's history. We should never forget what was done, but we do not need monuments glorifying the deeds of men who fought for the right to enslave and brutalize fellow human beings. A statue of Robert E. Lee mounting a majestic steed sends the message that the battles he fought were just and right. They were not.
