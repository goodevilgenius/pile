text: I just discovered this station on ~~Songza~~ Google Play Music. I was looking
  for some good background music for while I work, and noticed a collection of stations
  called "Coding Your Face Off". It consists of three stations full of action film
  soundtracks. Turns out it really does work as great background music while you're
  trying to "code your face off".
