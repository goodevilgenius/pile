title: "Why Mormons Don\u2019t Like Trump"
type: link

My wife and I were talking the other day about this. I feel like Mormons might decide this election. Most of the things that really tend to move Mormons towards the GOP (family values, conservative social issues, etc.) are not things espoused by Trump.

If Trump can't win over Mormons (and I don't think he will), he'll lose Utah, Idaho, and Arizona. And if he loses those three, he'll likely be unable to win the election.
