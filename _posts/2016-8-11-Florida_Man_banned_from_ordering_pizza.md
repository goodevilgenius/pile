You might find my suicide note the next day, had this happened to me.

> When I imagine a world without pizza deliveryâ€“ wait, stop. I don't want to go there. I don't even want to think about where a Florida man is right now, living a pizzaless existence after a judge banned him from ordering pies from any of his local pizzerias.
>
> He allegedly used five different phone numbers to make [harassing] calls, as well as fake names, or, in some cases, he'd just refuse to give a name at all. Businesses in the area say they lost at least 67 in food as a result. That's why, as a condition of his bail, the judge has ordered him to refrain from calling for any more pizza.
