@text > Paramount Pictures and CBS are suing the producers of a Star Trek fan film for copyright infringement.
> 
> In December 2015, the studios filed a complaint against Axanar. In a follow-up brief, they identify "infringing elements," including ... the Klingon language.
> 
> The way the court decides on the last item on that list has big legal implications. The Language Creation Society filed an amicus brief in support of the filmmakers. It argues that since Klingon was invented in the 1980s, the language has expanded beyond its origins — there's even a Klingon Language Institute. They say there's enough vocabulary in the language to translate Shakespeare's Hamlet. Klingon \took on a life of its own — a life that the Copyright Act has no power to control," they say.
> 
> The reason this matters — whether you can copyright a language — is related to programming. Is computer code a language, and can you copyright it? It goes to a long-running case between Oracle and Google.
> 
> Justin Lin, director of the upcoming — authorized — Star Trek: Beyond, tweeted his support:
> 
> > This is getting ridiculous! I support the fans. Trek belongs to all of us.
>
> And Mark Okrand, who created Klingon in 1984, and published the [first Klingon dictionary](http://www.amazon.com/Klingon-Dictionary-Star-Trek/dp/067174559X) in 1985, agrees. "Languages are something that you should use and you should feel free to use them and be encouraged to use them."

@text > With an advance that one cryptography expert called a "masterpiece," University of Texas at Austin computer scientists have developed a new method for producing truly random numbers, a breakthrough that could be used to encrypt data, make electronic voting more secure, conduct statistically significant polls and more accurately simulate complex systems such as Earth's climate.
> 
> The new method creates truly random numbers with less computational effort than other methods, which could facilitate significantly higher levels of security for everything from consumer credit card transactions to military communications.
>
> The new method takes two weakly random sequences of numbers and turns them into one sequence of truly random numbers. Weakly random sequences, such as air temperatures and stock market prices sampled over time, harbor predictable patterns. Truly random sequences have nothing predictable about them, like a coin toss.

@url https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=ubuntu-snaps-fedora&num=1
@text > Executing `snap find *` returned a... less than impressive list. In total there were 7 snaps available from the store for install-- 2 of which were example applications provided by Ubuntu.
>
> Now, to be fair to Canonical and Snapper... The idea behind Snapper is that of OS X (now MacOS) bundles. You don't download them from a central repository, you download them from the application authors directly.
>
> When one issues "sudo snap install" on an application, part of the downloading output is the total size of the snap. Since snap uses bundled libraries, I was rather curious to see how big these relatively simple applications would be:
>
> Ubuntu Clock App: 120.11 MB – admittedly, this is written in QML, so it has to pull in Qt. Ubuntu Calc App: 120.01 MB – same as above. LibreOffice*... 1.1 GB
>
> he Document Foundation's download page lists the sizes of all the various installers, broken down by operating system.
Windows x64? 238 MB. Mac OS X? 201 MB. Linux x64 RPM? 229 MB Linux x64 Deb? 229 MB
>
> So, even if you took all the installers for every OS and added them together, you would still come out at less used space than the single LibreOffice 5.2 Beta .snap package. To snap's credit, it did function. Less to snap's credit...the binary appeared to be Ubuntu-specific.

This seems incredibly wasteful of space. Every package includes all of its dependencies. What's the point in even having a package manager, then?

However, there was a very good point made on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/4o7d8y/playing_around_with_ubuntus_snaps_on_fedora/):

> Reading the comments I feel like people are missing the point of snaps. They aren't intended to replace your distro's package manager. I'm not even sure why some packages are in the snap repo, except perhaps to test it with certain large packages? (ie libreoffice?). What distro doesn't have Libreoffice?
>
> In my mind, snaps are best for applications that aren't in your distro already. Yes, they become inefficient on disk space (although space is cheap) but that one packages works on every distro that supports snaps.

@text Gary Johnson clarifies his views on religious freedom and his intention on the example he gave several days ago.

It's pretty clear that Johnson has a great deal of respect for Latter-Day Saints, and the utmost reverence for religious freedom.

> There have also been times in our history when religion has been invoked to justify serious harm. In years past, opponents of interracial marriage, desegregation and other efforts to protect civil rights too often cited scripture and religion in making their arguments.
>
> To be blunt, certain politicians have twisted religious liberty and used it as a tool to discriminate.
>
> Thus, in response to a question thrown at me while walking down a street (in the rain), I expressed my reservations rather emphatically — and cited the experience of Mormons as a case-in-point where religious persecution resulted in violent episodes right here in America.
>
> My point was that even a respected, peaceful people experienced tragic harm in the name of religion and was, in fact, persecuted by the government itself by politicians who opposed their beliefs and practices.
>
> I am well aware of the painful history of government interference with Mormons and the practice of their faith.
>
> In part because of this unique history, I believe Utah has found an appropriate balance in a religious freedom law that serves as an example to the rest of the country that non-discrimination and religious freedom are not opposing forces, but can instead go hand in hand.

@text ![John Carlos, Tommie Smith, and Peter Norman](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CLvU7OGWsAAEbrX.jpg)

> The two Americans had asked Norman if he believed in human rights. Norman said he did. They asked him if he believed in God, and he, who had been in the Salvation Army, said he believed strongly in God. "We knew that what we were going to do was far greater than any athletic feat, and he said 'I'll stand with you'" – remembers John Carlos – "I expected to see fear in Norman's eyes, but instead we saw love."
>
> Smith and Carlos had decided to get up on the stadium wearing the Olympic Project for Human Rights badge, a movement of athletes in support of the battle for equality.
>
> They would receive their medals barefoot, representing the poverty facing people of color. They would wear the famous black gloves, a symbol of the Black Panthers' cause. But before going up on the podium they realized they only had one pair of black gloves. "Take one each", Norman suggested. Smith and Carlos took his advice.
>
> But then Norman did something else. "I believe in what you believe. Do you have another one of those for me ?"
>
> There happened to be a white American rower with them, Paul Hoffman, an activist with the Olympic Project for Human Rights. After hearing everything he thought "if a white Australian is going to ask me for an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge, then by God he would have one!" Hoffman didn't hesitate: "I gave him the only one I had: mine".
>
> He was the greatest Australian sprinter in history and the holder of the 200 meter record, yet he wasn't even invited to the Olympics in Sydney. It was the American Olympic Committee, that once they learned of this news asked him to join their group and invited him to Olympic champion Michael Johnson's birthday party, for whom Peter Norman was a role model and a hero.
>
> Norman died suddenly from a heart attack in 2006, without his country ever having apologized for their treatment of him. At his funeral Tommie Smith and John Carlos, Norman's friends since that moment in 1968, were his pallbearers, sending him off as a hero.

@url http://nautil.us/issue/40/learning/how-to-tell-if-youre-a-jerk
@text > The scientifically recognized personality categories closest to "jerk" are the "dark triad" of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathic personality. Narcissists regard themselves as more important than the people around them, which jerks also implicitly or explicitly do. And yet narcissism is not quite jerkitude, since it also involves a desire to be the center of attention, a desire that jerks don't always have. Machiavellian personalities tend to treat people as tools they can exploit for their own ends, which jerks also do. And yet this too is not quite jerkitude, since Machivellianism involves self-conscious cynicism, while jerks can often be ignorant of their self-serving tendencies. People with psychopathic personalities are selfish and callous, as is the jerk, but they also incline toward impulsive risk-taking, while jerks can be calculating and risk-averse.
>
> Jerks see the world through goggles that dim others' humanity. The server at the restaurant is not a potentially interesting person with a distinctive personality, life story, and set of goals to which you might possibly relate. Instead, he is merely a tool by which to secure a meal or a fool on which you can vent your anger. The people ahead of you at Starbucks are faceless and of no account. Those beneath you in the social hierarchy lack your talents and deserve to get the scut work.
>
> To sharpen our conception of jerkitude, it's helpful also to consider the jerk's opposite: the sweetheart. Maybe you know one or two of these people—habitually alert to the needs and interests of others, solicitous of others' thoughts and preferences, liable in cases of conflict to suspect that the fault might lie with them rather than with the other party. Imagine flipping our jerk goggles inside out, converting them into sweetheart goggles—goggles that make especially vivid the value, interest, importance, and specialness of the people around you.

@tags news, geography
@text > The continent has shifted by 4.9 feet since the last adjustment was
made to GPS coordinates in 1994.
>
> All of the Earth’s continents float on tectonic plates, which glide
slowly over a plastic-like layer of the upper mantle. And the plate that
Australia sits on has been moving relatively fast, about 2.7 inches a year
(northward and with a slight clockwise rotation).
>
> This type of shifting is coming more into focus as GPS systems get more
accurate. The most advanced technology can now pinpoint a location to a
matter of inches. Although most consumer cellphones don’t have that level
of accuracy (yet), the technology is being used in other ways, including by
farmers who spray fields with precision agriculture and self-driving
vehicles. @end
